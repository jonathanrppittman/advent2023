This is a repository for my Advent of Code 2023 Solutions. Each file is named according to the day's problem.

I am starting late into Advent, and in my attempt to get as many problems done as possible, I am just solving them without further optimization once I reach a solution.
Thus, problems may not be completely optimized for time and space complexity.


I stored each puzzle input from https://adventofcode.com/ into a text file for my convenience. You will need the respective day's text file in the same directory as the Python script solution for it to run.
